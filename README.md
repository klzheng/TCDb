## TCDb

Movie tracking websites like IMDb and Letterboxd already exist. However, everyone has their preferences and there were still things that I didn't like that ultimately drove me to create my own web application:

- **Track, rate, and see films all in one place for personal use**  &ndash;   While a community is important in many places, most days I just want the simple functionality of seeing what shows I've watched and what shows I bookmarked.  

- **Letterboxd doesn't include TV shows in their database** &ndash;  This can be frustrating for some users if they want to keep all their favorite TV shows and movies in one place.

- **Both IMDb and Letterboxd only allow user ratings in half integer (star) increments** &ndash;  I personally found this to be very limiting as it paints a very black and white picture that isn't quite accurate in my opinion. 

Also, building a fullstack CRUD app like TCDb is a great way to learn, practice, and demonstrate my skills üòä
